    "question": "Create a Flutter app widget that displays a real-time list of messages retrieved from the Firebase Realtime Database. The widget should automatically update when new messages are added to the database. Additionally, implement a feature to add new messages to the database directly from the widget. Ensure the messages are sorted by timestamp and handle any potential errors during data retrieval or submission.",

        "Utilize Flutter's StreamBuilder for real-time updates.",

        "Handle sorting of messages by timestamp within the app.",
        "Proper error handling must be implemented for data retrieval and submission."

    "examples": "Input: User adds a new message 'Hello World' from the Flutter app. Expected Output: The message list in the app updates in real-time and the new message 'Hello World' appears ordered by timestamp. Additionally, Firebase Realtime Database reflects this new entry.",
