    "question": "Create a function in Node.js that will accept a string representing a sequence of opening and closing parentheses, such as '()()()' or '(()', and determine if the sequence is balanced. For a sequence to be balanced, every opening parenthesis must be followed by a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order. Your function should return true if the sequence is balanced and false otherwise. In React, create a simple component that allows the user to input a sequence of parentheses and displays the validation result using the Node.js function.",
