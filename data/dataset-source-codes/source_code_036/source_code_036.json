    "question": "You have been tasked with building a custom collection pipeline in Laravel that performs a series of operations on a collection of numerical data. You need to create a chainable pipeline that applies the following operations in order: filter out numbers less than 10, then calculate the square of remaining numbers, and finally compute the average of the squared numbers. Use Laravel collections and their built-in methods to accomplish this, avoiding any loops.",
