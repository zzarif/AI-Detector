    "question": "Design and implement a function in Python that simulates rolling a six-sided die. The function should use a pseudo-random number generator and ensure that each number from 1 to 6 has an approximately equal probability of appearing over a large number of rolls. Additionally, write a secondary function that takes a number n as input and simulates rolling the die n times, returning a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each result.",

        "Use the random module from Python's standard library.",
        "Do not use any external libraries."
