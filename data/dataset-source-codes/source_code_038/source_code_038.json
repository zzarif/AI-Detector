The module should have endpoints to add new products, update existing product quantities, fetch a list of products, and check if a product can be ordered in a certain quantity. Each product has a unique identifier, name, description, price, and available quantity. Ensure the use of proper DTOs and interfaces for type safety, and handle possible exceptions accurately. Optimize your database interaction for batch updates.",
